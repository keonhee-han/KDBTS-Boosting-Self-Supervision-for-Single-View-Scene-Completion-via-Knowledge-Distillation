YAML configuration files specifie settings for training a MVBTSNet neural network model on the KITTI 360 or KITTI dataset. It outlines parameters for various aspects of the training, including data processing, model configuration, loss functions, and the training schedule. Here are some key details:

# General Settings
The model to be used is MVBTSNet. The output from this training run will be stored in the directory "out/kitti_360". The training will run for predefined epochs with the batch size.

# Data Parameters
The data configuration specifies that the model will use color augmentation and preprocessing. The images will be resized to a size of 192x640. The fisheye_rotation parameter is set to [0, -15] degrees, suggesting some form of geometric transformation on the input data.

# Model Configuration
The main architecture of the model is MVBTSNet. The encoder type is "monodepth2". The mlp_coarse and mlp_fine parameters dictate the architecture of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) used in the coarse and fine stages of MVBTSNet respectively. The MLP for the coarse stage is a resnet with 0 blocks and 64 hidden dimensions, while the MLP for the fine stage is an "empty" type with 1 block and 128 hidden dimensions.

# Loss Parameters
The loss function used is a combination of L1 and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) losses. The policy for handling invalid values in the loss computation is "weight_guided". The lambda_edge_aware_smoothness is a weight parameter for the edge-aware smoothness loss term, which encourages the model to produce depth maps with smooth transitions except at the edges of objects.

# Scheduler Parameters
The scheduler type is "step", indicating that the learning rate will be decreased at certain intervals (step size of 120000) by a factor of 0.1.

# Renderer Parameters
The renderer will use 64 coarse samples, and no fine samples. Other parameters include the standard deviation for the depth (depth_std), a flag indicating whether to use linearized disparity (lindisp), and a flag for a hard alpha cap.


# File Stucture
- baselines/* : This is the folder where the baseline training or evaluation configurations are stored. e.g. DFT
- eval_* : Evaluation configurations for the desired MV- or KDBTS model
- train_* : Training configurations where you can train from scratch for *_base.yaml, and knowledge distillation for *_KD.yaml with the pretrained MVBTS model.
- data/* : default configuration for loading dataset.
