#This YAML configuration file specifies settings for training a BTSNet neural network model on the KITTI 360 dataset. It outlines parameters for various aspects of the training, including data processing, model configuration, loss functions, and the training schedule. Here are some key details:
#General Settings: The model to be used is BTSNet. The output from this training run will be stored in the directory "out/kitti_360". The training will run for 25 epochs with a batch size of 16.
#Data Parameters: The data configuration specifies that the model will use color augmentation and preprocessing. The images will be resized to a size of 192x640. The fisheye_rotation parameter is set to [0, -15] degrees, suggesting some form of geometric transformation on the input data.
#Model Configuration: The main architecture of the model is BTSNet. The encoder type is "monodepth2", a popular model for depth estimation, with 50 ResNet layers. The mlp_coarse and mlp_fine parameters dictate the architecture of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) used in the coarse and fine stages of BTSNet respectively. The MLP for the coarse stage is a resnet with 0 blocks and 64 hidden dimensions, while the MLP for the fine stage is an "empty" type with 1 block and 128 hidden dimensions.
#Loss Parameters: The loss function used is a combination of L1 and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) losses. The policy for handling invalid values in the loss computation is "weight_guided". The lambda_edge_aware_smoothness is a weight parameter for the edge-aware smoothness loss term, which encourages the model to produce depth maps with smooth transitions except at the edges of objects.
#Scheduler Parameters: The scheduler type is "step", indicating that the learning rate will be decreased at certain intervals (step size of 120000) by a factor of 0.1.
#Renderer Parameters: The renderer will use 64 coarse samples, and no fine samples. Other parameters include the standard deviation for the depth (depth_std), a flag indicating whether to use linearized disparity (lindisp), and a flag for a hard alpha cap.
#These settings provide an overall blueprint for training the BTSNet model on the specified dataset.
